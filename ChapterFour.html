        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          The requirements for a system describe what the system should do and the constraints on its operation.
          They reflect the needs of customers and stakeholders, whether the purpose is controlling a device,
          placing an order, or finding information.
        </p>
        <p>The term <em>requirement</em> can mean:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User requirements:</strong> High-level statements and diagrams describing system services and constraints in a form understandable by users.</li>
          <li><strong>System requirements:</strong> Detailed descriptions of system functions, services, and constraints, often forming part of a contractual agreement.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>

        <h2>Example: User vs System Requirements</h2>
        <p><strong>User requirement:</strong> The MHC-PMS shall generate monthly management reports showing the cost of drugs prescribed by each clinic.</p>
        <p><strong>System requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>On the last working day of each month, generate a summary of prescribed drugs, their cost, and the prescribing clinics.</li>
          <li>Automatically prepare reports for printing after 17:30 on that day.</li>
          <li>Create reports per clinic listing drug names, total prescriptions, doses, and total costs.</li>
          <li>Generate separate reports for each dose unit (e.g., 10 mg, 20 mg).</li>
          <li>Restrict access to cost reports to authorized users on the management access list.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4.1 Functional and Non-functional Requirements</h2>
        <p>Software requirements are commonly divided into two categories:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Functional requirements:</strong> Services the system should provide, reactions to inputs, and behavior in specific situations.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-functional requirements:</strong> Constraints on services or functions, such as performance, standards, or regulations.</li>
        </ol>

      <article>
        <h2>4.1.1 Functional Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Functional requirements describe the functionality or system services. They depend
          on the type of software being developed, the expected users, and the general approach
          taken by the organization when writing requirements.

        <h2>4.1.2 Non-functional Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Non-functional requirements are constraints on the services or functions offered by the system.
          These may include performance, security, and availability. They often apply to the system as a whole.

        <h2>4.1.3 Classification of Non-functional Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Non-functional requirements can be classified into product, organizational, and external requirements.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Product requirements:</strong> e.g., execution speed or reliability.</li>
          <li><strong>Organizational requirements:</strong> e.g., process standards or implementation requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>External requirements:</strong> e.g., legislative or regulatory requirements.</li>

      <article>
        <h2>4.2 The Software Requirements Document</h2>
        <p>
          The software requirements document is the official statement of what is required of
          system developers. It includes both a definition of user requirements and a
          specification of system requirements.
        </p>

    </section>

    <section id="requirements-specification">
      <article>
        <h2>4.3 Requirements Specification</h2>
        <p>
          Requirements specification is the activity of writing down user and system requirements.
          User requirements should be written in a way understandable by system users without technical knowledge.
        </p>

    <section id="requirements-validation">
      <article>
        <h2>4.4 Requirements Validation</h2>
        <p>
          Requirements validation checks that requirements define the system the customer really wants.
          It involves identifying problems with requirements.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Validity:</strong> Does the system support customer needs?</li>
          <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Are there conflicts?</li>
          <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Are all required functions included?</li>
          <li><strong>Realism:</strong> Can they be implemented within budget/technology?</li>
          <li><strong>Verifiability:</strong> Can they be tested?</li>

        <h2>4.5 Requirements Management</h2>
        <p>
          Requirements management is the process of handling changing requirements during development.
